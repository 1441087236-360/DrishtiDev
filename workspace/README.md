## üî• Database Setup (Firebase)

The real-time collaboration feature requires a Firebase project. If you don't have one, follow these steps to create one for free.

1.  **Go to the Firebase Console**: Navigate to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.
2.  **Create a Project**:
    *   Click on **"Add project"** or **"Create a project"**.
    *   Give your project a name (e.g., "DrishtiDev-Workspace") and click **Continue**.
    *   You can disable Google Analytics for this project if you wish. It's not required.
    *   Click **"Create project"** and wait for it to be provisioned.
3.  **Add a Web App**:
    *   Once your project is ready, you'll be on the project dashboard.
    *   Click the **Web icon** (`</>`) to add a new web application.
    *   Give your app a nickname (e.g., "DrishtiDev App") and click **"Register app"**.
4.  **Get Your Config Keys**:
    *   After registering, Firebase will show you a `firebaseConfig` object. **These are most of the keys you need.**
    *   Keep this page open, or find these keys again later by going to **Project Settings** (‚öôÔ∏è icon) > **Your apps** > **SDK setup and configuration**.
    *   Copy the values for `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, `storageBucket`, `messagingSenderId`, and `appId` into the corresponding `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables in your `.env.local` file.
5.  **Enable Realtime Database**:
    *   In the main left-hand menu, go to **Build > Realtime Database**.
    *   Click **"Create Database"**.
    *   Choose a location for your database (any location is fine).
    *   Select **"Start in test mode"** for the security rules. This allows the app to work easily for development. Click **Enable**.
6.  **Get Your Database URL**:
    *   After the database is created, you will see its URL at the top (e.g., `https://<your-project-id>-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com`).
    *   Copy this URL and paste it as the value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` in your `.env.local` file.

## ü§ñ Google AI Key Setup (Gemini)

The AI Assistant features are powered by Google's Gemini models.

2.  **Create API Key**: Click the **"Create API key"** button.
3.  **Copy the Key**: A new key will be generated for you. Copy it.
